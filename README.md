# Global Water Consumption Prediction
This project focuses on Big Data Analytics to predict total water consumption for global countries over the years 2000 to 2024. The dataset used in this analysis contains various metrics related to water consumption, including total water consumption, per capita water use, water scarcity levels, and more for each country.

Tools and Technologies Used:
1. Jupyter Notebook: We used Jupyter Notebook to process, analyze, and model the data. The notebook provides a flexible environment for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.
2. Snowflake: Snowflake was used as the cloud-based data warehouse for storing and managing the dataset. We utilized Snowflake's SQL capabilities for efficient querying and data retrieval.
3. Machine Learning Models: We trained a predictive model using the dataset, aiming to forecast total water consumption based on historical data.


Project Overview:
1. Dataset: The dataset spans from the year 2000 to 2024, providing valuable insights into global water consumption trends across various countries. It includes columns such as total water consumption (in billion cubic meters), per capita water use, agricultural water use, and more.
2. Data Processing: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to normalize features for model training.
3. Model Training: We implemented machine learning models to predict total water consumption. The goal was to analyze trends and project future consumption patterns based on historical data.
4. Snowflake Integration: Data was queried from Snowflake using SQL for efficient data handling. Predictions were also stored back into Snowflake for further analysis and reporting.


Key Features:
1.	Data Exploration: Visualizations to explore relationships between various metrics such as water scarcity, agricultural use, and total water consumption.
2. Model Evaluation: We evaluated the prediction model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to ensure accurate forecasts.
3. Predictions: The model predicts future water consumption based on the trends identified in the dataset, aiding in strategic planning for water resource management.
